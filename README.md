# Transportation Network Analysis between Provincial Capitals in Indonesia

This project aims to visualize and analyze the transportation network between provincial capitals in Indonesia using graph and network theory concepts. The project provides insights into the connectivity between cities through a graph representation based on geographical relationships and possible transportation routes. The analysis is conducted by measuring two main metrics, namely degree centrality and betweenness centrality, to identify cities with the greatest influence in the network.
